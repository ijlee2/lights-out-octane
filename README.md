# Lights Out - Octane

This is the code companion to my [Ember-D3 tutorial](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2018/04/07/lights-out/), presented at the Ember ATX Meetup on 4/26/2018.

I updated the Ember project to use Octane features.

## How to Run

You can run the app as is.

1. Do `npm install`.

2. Run `ember s`, then visit `localhost:4200`.

## Octane v. Pre-Octane

You can find the [pre-Octane app on GitHub](https://github.com/ijlee2/lights-out). To learn more about the differences, please see my [blog post](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/12/23/rewriting-apps-in-ember-octane/).
